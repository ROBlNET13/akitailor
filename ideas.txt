 Custom Accessory Importing
    Import custom items such as bases, hats and clothes

 Saving a render of your Akinator
    Maybe add stats too? (A thing saying "This Akinator won {NUMBER} games!")

 Outfit Saving
    Have a maximum of 10 outfit slots

 CSS Layer Styling
    Have a couple of preset CSS filters for people unfamiliar with CSS,
    but have an option to set your own filters for those who know what they're doing
    This would allow for more overall customization
    Maybe also add a Shadow toggle?
    Maybe also add a way to adjust the position of each layer along with this?
    Animation effects such as glowing could be nice for layers

 Popup Background Changing
    Have the ability to set a custom background for the popup

 Extension Icon Being the Akinator
    The icon for the extension could be a small headshot render of the Akinator
    This would be a good idea because
  1. i have no fucking idea what i would put for the icon honestly
  2. would be a neat detail that people might enjoy (having a tiny akinator in your extensions would be fun and silly)

 Toggle for a little CSS float animation
    Would make the Akinator not look as static
