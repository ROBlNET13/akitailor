# Akitailor

Adds Akitude customization like the mobile Akinator app to the web version.

Currently only available as a Chrome extension.

The extension will soon be published here: https://chromewebstore.google.com/detail/gjdplcnfnkhjbadollbdoiehbhecdcfo

## Building the extension

1. Install dependencies:
```bash
pnpm install
```

2. Build the extension:
```bash
pnpm build
```

This will create a minified build in a temporary directory and generate an `akitailor.zip` file ready for distribution.
